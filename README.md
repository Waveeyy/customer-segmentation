# CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS

This Python-based project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) analysis and K-Means clustering on the Online Retail II dataset to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The aim is to enable businesses to target specific groups of customers more effectively in marketing campaigns, ultimately improving customer retention and increasing sales.

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a passionate Data Science enthusiast with a focus on Machine Learning, currently advancing my education with an MSc in Business Analytics. This project serves as a testament to my growing expertise in customer data analysis, offering valuable insights for personalized marketing strategies.

## Local Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the Customer Segmentation Analysis project on your local environment for development and experimentation.

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.6+
- pip
- Virtual environment (Recommended)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine and navigate into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/customer-segmentation.git
cd customer-segmentation
```

### Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

Creating a virtual environment is optional but recommended to manage dependencies efficiently:

**Windows:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Required Packages

Install all necessary Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Analysis

Execute the Python script to perform the customer segmentation analysis:

```bash
python rfm.py
```

### Analysis Results

The script outputs RFM analysis results and applies K-Means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. Explore the clusters to understand different customer profiles.


Leveraging data-driven insights from RFM analysis and K-Means clustering, this project demonstrates how businesses can enhance their marketing strategies by understanding and targeting customer segments more effectively.

Feel free to explore the codes and dataset in this repository to gain deeper insights into customer segmentation techniques and their application in real-world business scenarios.
